## Installation

```
pip install image-viewer-mk2
```

Additional dependencies must be installed separately: `happy` (currently not publicly available), optional: `PyTorch` (for GPU-based rendering), `pywin32` (Windows clipboard functionality)

## Usage

**From within python scripts and interactive sessions.** Image viewer returns the rendered image back so that it can be further used inside the script.
```
import image_viewer_mk2.app as imv

img = np.zeros((height, width, channels))
render = imv.start(image=img)
```

**From command line as a standalone application.**
```
> imvmk2 [-i filename] [-c config_filename] [-g (GPU) | -ng (No GPU)] [-d (debug)]
```
